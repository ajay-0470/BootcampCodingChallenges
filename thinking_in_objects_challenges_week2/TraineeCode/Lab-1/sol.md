The example highlights the difference between accessing the class attributes directly and by using the classes getters and setters.

account_manager1 sets the field values directly by accessing the the corresponding objects fields where as account_manager2 calls the setters of the class to initialize the passed values.

This is possible because python does not enforce access specifiers like C++ or Java and instead relies on the developer to implement according to  the conventions.
